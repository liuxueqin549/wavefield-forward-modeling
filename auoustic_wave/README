This is a microseismic forward modeling code with acoustic wave. Finiite difference mathod is used to solve the wave equation.
V1 is the input velocity model. The default siza is 300* 300, which can be change.
There are the meaning of parameters:
x0: horizontal location of source
z0: vertical location of source
dx,dz: intervel of x,z
dt: time intervel
T: length of record

You need to make sure that V*dt>dx/4 to run this code.
